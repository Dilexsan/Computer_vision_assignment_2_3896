# 🧠 Image Processing with Otsu's Thresholding and Region Growing

This project demonstrates two fundamental image processing techniques using OpenCV:

- **Otsu’s Thresholding**: Automatic thresholding to segment foreground from background.
- **Region Growing**: Segmentation starting from a seed pixel based on intensity similarity.
